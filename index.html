        <p>I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1997. Currently I attend
        Washington and Lee University where I am on the swim team. Additionally,
        I am a Computer Science and Classics double major and I participate in 
        the work-study program as a technician for the IT Service department. 
        This past summer, I did Politics research with a two of my peers and 
        Professor Rush.</p>

        <h2>College Career</h2>
        <p>
            Coming in to Washington and Lee, I was intent on majoring in Physics in order to go on to become an engineer.
            While I appreciated the academic challenge that these courses presented, I was not passionate about the subject matter. 
            I pivoted to Computer Science because I wanted to continue to practice the problem-solving skills
            which originally drew me to Physics but I was also curious about how to harness the power of 
            modern computers.

        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p>
            During my sophomore year of high school, I signed up for an automotive technology class mainly to fill 
            my credit hour requirement, but I was also curious about how a car generates kinetic energy at the 
            press of a pedal. Throughout the course of the class, I found myself becoming more interested in the 
            systems at work inside the modern car and how they interact with one another. by the end of the year, 
            I had decided that I wanted not only to continue my education in the shop, but that I would also take 
            Honors Physics to explore the underlying physical principles.
