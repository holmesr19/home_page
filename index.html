            I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1997. In 2015, I graduated from Needham B. Broughton High School
            after being a four-year letter winner on the swim team and being a captain of that team for my last two
            years. I was recruited to study and swim at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, VA and began my 
            time there in the Fall of 2015. At first, in this new environment, I had trouble finding the motivation 
            to excel in my studies while balancing swimming on top of my studies. However, a few weeks into my first 
            computer science class in the fall of my sophomore year, I knew that I had found something I was passionate 
            about. The power that was at my fingertips was impressive; in just a few keystrokes I could manipulate and
            analyze huge sets of data with ease. Furthermmore, I was thrilled with how surprisingly creative the 
            programming process is. I have always enjoyed creating and building things and since there are so many 
            different ways to decompose and solve a problem, I discovered that building a program is not so different 
            from building a table or composing a watercolor. <!--need more academics earlier and more swimming later, probably 2 <p>-->

        <h2>College Career</h2>
        <p>
            Coming in to Washington and Lee, I was intent on majoring in Physics in order to become an engineer.
            While I appreciated the academic challenge that these courses presented, I was not passionate about the subject matter. 
            I pivoted to Computer Science because I wanted to continue to practice the problem-solving skills
            which originally drew me to Physics but I was also fascinated with the power that computers can 
            put to use.

            The Classics component of my major happened almost by accident. I had taken Latin throughout high school
            and thus was able to skip the first two semesters and start out with an intermediate course focusing on
            prose. I jumped on this because it allowed me to finish my language graduation requirement a year early.
            The next semester, I took a course taught by Professor Michael Laughy and I was hooked. I knew that I wanted
            to continue learning about this topic and hopefully contribute to it one day. <!--I am making that vision become 
            a reality with <a href = 'projects.html#catullus'>this</a> project I began over the summer of 2018-->

        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p>
            During my sophomore year of high school, I signed up for an automotive technology class mainly to fill 
            my credit hour requirement, but I was also curious about how a car generates kinetic energy at the 
            press of a pedal. Throughout the course of the class, I found myself becoming more interested in the 
            systems at work inside the modern car and how they interact with one another. by the end of the year, 
            I had decided that I wanted not only to continue my education in the shop, but that I would also take 
            Honors Physics to explore the underlying physical principles.
