# home_page

I built this site to showcase some experience I have had working with various technologies. I wanted a place where I could bundle up all the important things that someone may want to know about me in a way that a resume or linkedin profile does not quite capture. 

Throughout the development of the site I have also been presented with the opportunity to practice HTML, CSS and, to a limited degree, JavaScript.
