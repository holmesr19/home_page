                    The Latin Library Web Scraper
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        I decided to pursue this project because I think mastering the ability to scrape data from webpages is a powerful
                        way to collect data. I chose <a href = 'http://thelatinlibrary.com/indices.html'>the Latin Library</a> because it
                        has a huge corpus of latin texts from many different authors, spanning over a millennium. This represents a huge

                    Catullus Text Analysis
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        I started to think about this project in my advanced Latin poetry class where we read Catullus
                        and parts of Ovid's erotic poems and Metamorphoses. At the end of the class, we were assigned a 
                        paper to write about any topic that we talked about in the class. I thought it would be 
                        interesting to use the skills that I had learned in my computer science classes to produce a novel
                        analysis of the material that we covered in class and so I began to research how I might go about
                        such a project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing that I didn't realize until probably too late is how intensive such a project would be for
                        a student in my position at the time. The assignment was given to us six weeks before it was due at
                        the end of the semester and it took approximately four weeks of resarch to realize that I was in way
                        over my head, having never taken a single class that would help me carry out a text analysis. Thankfully,
                        I was able to revisit the project in the summer of 2018 with more time to research the tools necesary 
                        for the project.

                    <p>
                        The Java Freecell game was a step-by-step project completed by myself and my four team mates, 
                        Gillen Beck, Rebecca Melkerson, Liz Curtis, and Emily Boyes. We built the project in a step-wise
                        fashion, starting by building a simple war game and and devloping it into a full-fledged, GUI game
                        of Freecell solitaire. We made extensive use of the <a href = "">Solitaire Laboratory</a> to 
                        add to our understanding of gameplay and decide how to organize the application.
                    </p>
                    <!--<button id="showMore">Show More</button>-->
                    <div id="209_hidden">
                    <p>
                        The first step of our project was creating a game of war. This was a GUI as well; throughout the
                        entire project we edited and added on to the same original code base. The GUI displayed the top 
                        card on each players stack and judged which player won. There was a console in the center of the 
                        pane to inform the players of the actions that the controller was manipulating the model with. If 
                        the two cards had the same rank, they would be held until the next two cards were played and so on
                        until one player wins a pairing, thereby claiming the whole pile of tied cards. At the end of a game, 
                        or whenever a player hit the "New Game" button, the whole instance of the game would be discarded and
                        a new deck object would be created to be dealt to each player.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the next few weeks, we were tasked with transforming the game of war we had built into a complete
                        game of Freecell. Using the MVC model, we broke it into three smaller projects: one developing the GUI 
                        display, one developing the behind-the-scenes logic of the game, and one working on the controller that
                        takes information from the GUI view to update the model and vice versa. When testing end cases, we ran 
                        into a number of situations that made us look back at the rule book and then revise our model. One of 
                        the toughest end cases was when you had played yourself into a hole, meaning you had no possible moves
                        remaining and you hadn't won. At first, the game would let you play indefinitelyin this scenario so we 
                        had to add methods to calculate the possible number of moves that could be made with the game in its 
                        current state and notify the player if that move was 0, in which case the game was lost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I thought this functionality would be a nice thing to tell the user for each move, so I added a box at 
                        the bottom left of the GUI that displays this number after every move. While I was at it I thought it 
                        would also be of interest to the player to know in how many moves he or she solved the hand, so at the 
                        bottom right I added a counter for the number of moves that have been completed. Upon revisiting this 
                        project lately, I think it would be a worthwhile addition to also add a button that will suggest the 
                        best possible move at the current time and also a screen that can be visited that tells what moves have
                        been made.

                </h3>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the winter of 2018 I was able to work with the City of Buena Vista's Planning and
                        Community Development department and its director, Tom Roberts. This position gave me the 
                        opportunity to see first-hand how a planning department uses geospatial data to improve the 
                        conditions of a city. The main focus of my efforts throughout the internship were on a 
                        revision of the City of Buena Vista's Comprehensive Plan, creating a GIS of crashes in the
                        city and surrounding areas, creating an app that allows City employees to report code violations,
                        and a Python program that reads the City's real estate database and rewrites each parcel as 
                        an atomic value with the correct account number.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first project I undertook with the City of Buena Vista was helping to revise their 5-year
                        comprehensive plan. Specifically, I was looking at their demographic data and how it has 
                        changed since the last publication. Using data from 2010 Census which was not available at
                        the time of previous publication, I updated charts that showed the age, population size 
                        and racial makeup of the city. Additionally, I updated maps showing population density,
                        age, and racial makeup of the different sectors of the city. Finally, the analysis of
                        the data had to be revised to match the new figures along with new estimates of where the
                        aforementioned metrics will be in the future. We used the University of Virginia's Weldon
                        Cooper Center's population estimates in these cases. <!--revisit this, sounds wrong-->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another project I had the chance to work on is making a GIS that displays all the car 
                        accidents that had occurred in the city, color coded by the season in which they occurred.
                        The Planning Department wanted this map to see what effect the local college, Southern
                        Virginia University, had on car wrecks in the city. The data came from the the Virginia
                        Department of Transportation <!--link here-->. We wanted to see whether the number of 
                        accidents increased in the fall when students moved in. The good news is that the 
                        data from the Department of Highways had dates and GPS coordinates. Unfortunately, 
                        the dates were not in a format recognized by Excel. This meant that I would have to 
                        classify the 170 accidents manually, unless I found another way. This is exactly what I 
                        did; using a few SQL statements I was able to code the accidents by season and then easily
                        upload them to ArcGIS to display them in space and color code them. This showed that the 
                        number of accidents actually decreased in the fall. Furthermore, the GIS showed that not 
                        only were accidents relatively steady throughout the year but they are also roughly 
                        proportional to the number of cars travelling on a road.<!--photo in this <p>-->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A quick project that I was asked to put together was an app that allowed city employees
                        to report code infractions such as inoperable vehicles in the yard or derelict structures
                        on the property. I used Survey123 with ArcGIS Online to create the app in which the user 
                        can report up to three infractions and optionally add pictures of the offenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My favorite project that I worked on was a Python program that transforms the multi-valued 
                        attributes in the City's real estate database into atomic values. This project was used to
                        write the data into a format that could be joined with the City's real estate GIS. The problem
                        with the data was that although they had every parcel enumerated in the GIS, they did not have
                        the account number of the parcel's owner attached to it. They did have the account numbers,
                        along with every parcel that account owned, in an excel spreadsheet but it was in an anomalous
                        format, as is seen below left. They needed the data in a standardized form with a single parcel 
                        number linked to an account number so that it could be joined to the parcel numbers database that
                        already existed on their GIS.

                        The Mowbot is a remote-controlled, electric lawnmower. It was designed and built for a
                        project-based Robotics class, CS 250 with Professor Moataz Khalifa. An on-board Arduino 
                        received a signal from our remote control (a repurposed r/c airplane remote), processed 
                        it, and sent out the appropriate signals to the motors and relay that controlled the cutting
                        head. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We encountered a few obstacles along the way, as one would expect with a project such as this.
                        First, we realized that we would need to cut weight in order to stay within a reasonable budget
                        for the class. We were originally planning to make a product very similar to 
                        <a href = "http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-RC-Lawnmower/" target = "_blank">this</a>, however the weight of
                        the cutting head would necessitate heavier, more expensive motors and thus heavier, more expensive 
                        batteries. We solved this problem by opting to go with a weed wacker cutting head instead of the 
                        lawnmower head. This decision paid dividends since it came with its own battery, plus it would turn 
                        out to be easier to mount on the frame.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we got the parts list nailed down, we moved on to designing the chassis. Two group members 
                        conceived two separate ideas. Sketches of the two ideas can be seen at right. Our last order of business 
                        before we were able to break into teams and start building was to decide between the two. The two group
                        members made a presentation on the merits of his design and a confidential vote was taken. The results of
                        the vote were accepted unanimously and the meeting was adjourned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, we broke into two groups of three. The shop group, which I was on, was tasked with building a 
                        chassis that the electronics group could more-or-less snap their work into to create a working lawnmower.
                        We spent about ten days cutting, grinding, drilling and screwing in the Physics annex, although a not-
                        insignificant portion of our time was spent figuring how we could connect one part to another without 
                        bringing the entire project, figuratively and literally, to a screeching halt. Surprisingly, no such
                        derailment occurred. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning of the fourth week, we were finally ready to put the electronic and mechanical systems 
                        together. We were pleasantly surprised when the systems seemed to fit together seemlessly. We snapped 
                        everything in to place, plugged the battery in and turned on our controller. One of my team mates pushed 
                        the joystick on the controller forward. The machine started crawling forward then the chain jumped off 
                        the sprocket. Fixing this came to be our obsession over the next few days, brainstorming and testing a 
                        few different ways to keep the chain on the sprockets. Eventually we settled on a shortening the chains 
                        and also adding guards around the sprockets to guide the chain. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a week full of trial and error getting the chain to stay on the sprockets, we had finally come upon
                        a solution the day before we were to present the project. We met in the lab a few hours before the 
                        presentation was scheduled to start to run our final tests. One problem that we discovered on that last day
                        was that although our motors had no problem moving the robot around on the smooth marble floors of the 
                        science building, once it was put in grass it no longer was able to overcome the resistancce from the surface.
                        We were disappointed by this since we did not have time to fit it with more powerful motors however we were
                        happy that all the systems worked correctly. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We decided on a few steps that would be necessary to take in order for the project to advance. First, we 
                        should convert the chain-driven wheels to direct drive. Even though we did end up coming up with a patch for
                        the chain's slipping off, that took up a significant amount of time and it still wasn't perfect. We also hope 
                        to be able to attach a GPS module to the machine which would allow us to geofence a polygon within which the 
                        machine would map its own route. Ultimately, this would mean that the user has to program the boundaries of 
                        the yard once and then the Mowbot will do its job on its own with no further input needed from the human.
