                    <p>
                        The Mowbot is a remote-controlled, electric lawnmower. It was designed and built for a
                        project-based Robotics class, CS 250 with Professor Moataz Khalifa. An on-board Arduino 
                        received a signal from our remote control (a repurposed r/c airplane remote), processed 
                        it, and sent out the appropriate signals to the motors and relay that controlled the cutting
                        head. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We encountered a few obstacles along the way, as one would expect with a project such as this.
                        First, we realized that we would need to cut weight in order to stay within a reasonable budget
                        for the class. We were originally planning to make a product very similar to 
                        <a href = "http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-RC-Lawnmower/" target = "_blank">this</a>, however the weight of
                        the cutting head would necessitate heavier, more expensive motors and thus heavier, more expensive 
                        batteries. We solved this problem by opting to go with a weed wacker cutting head instead of the 
                        lawnmower head. This decision paid dividends since it came with its own battery, plus it would turn 
                        out to be easier to mount on the frame.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we got the parts list nailed down, we moved on to designing the chassis. Two group members 
                        conceived two separate ideas. Sketches of the two ideas can be seen at right. Our last order of business 
                        before we were able to break into teams and start building was to decide between the two. The two group
                        members made a presentation on the merits of his design and a confidential vote was taken. The results of
                        the vote were accepted unanimously and the meeting was adjourned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, we broke into two groups of three. The shop group, which I was on, was tasked with building a 
                        chassis that the electronics group could more-or-less snap their work into to create a working lawnmower.
                        We spent about ten days cutting, grinding, drilling and screwing in the Physics annex, although a not-
                        insignificant portion of our time was spent figuring how we could connect one part to another without 
                        bringing the entire project, figuratively and literally, to a screeching halt. Surprisingly, no such
                        derailment occurred.
