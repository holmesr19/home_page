                    <p>
                        The Mowbot is a remote-controlled, electric lawnmower. It was designed and built for a
                        project-based Robotics class, CS 250 with Professor Moataz Khalifa. An on-board Arduino 
                        received a signal from our remote control (a repurposed r/c airplane remote), processed 
                        it, and sent out the appropriate signals to the motors and relay that controlled the cutting
                        head. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We encountered a few obstacles along the way, as one would expect with a project such as this.
                        First, we realized that we would need to cut weight in order to stay within a reasonable budget
                        for the class. We were originally planning to make a product very similar to 
                        <a href = "http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-RC-Lawnmower/" target = "_blank">this</a>, however the weight of
                        the cutting head would necessitate heavier, more expensive motors and thus heavier, more expensive 
                        batteries. We solved this problem by opting to go with a weed wacker cutting head instead of the 
                        lawnmower head. This decision paid dividends since it came with its own battery, plus it would turn 
                        out to be easier to mount on the frame.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we got the parts list nailed down, we moved on to designing the chassis. Two group members 
                        conceived two separate ideas. Sketches of the two ideas can be seen at right. Our last order of business 
                        before we were able to break into teams and start building was to decide between the two. The two group
                        members made a presentation on the merits of his design and a confidential vote was taken. The results of
                        the vote were accepted unanimously and the meeting was adjourned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, we broke into two groups of three. The shop group, which I was on, was tasked with building a 
                        chassis that the electronics group could more-or-less snap their work into to create a working lawnmower.
                        We spent about ten days cutting, grinding, drilling and screwing in the Physics annex, although a not-
                        insignificant portion of our time was spent figuring how we could connect one part to another without 
                        bringing the entire project, figuratively and literally, to a screeching halt. Surprisingly, no such
                        derailment occurred. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning of the fourth week, we were finally ready to put the electronic and mechanical systems 
                        together. We were pleasantly surprised when the systems seemed to fit together seemlessly. We snapped 
                        everything in to place, plugged the battery in and turned on our controller. One of my team mates pushed 
                        the joystick on the controller forward. The machine started crawling forward then the chain jumped off 
                        the sprocket. Fixing this came to be our obsession over the next few days, brainstorming and testing a 
                        few different ways to keep the chain on the sprockets. Eventually we settled on a shortening the chains 
                        and also adding guards around the sprockets to guide the chain. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a week full of trial and error getting the chain to stay on the sprockets, we had finally come upon
                        a solution the day before we were to present the project. We met in the lab a few hours before the 
                        presentation was scheduled to start to run our final tests. One problem that we discovered on that last day
                        was that although our motors had no problem moving the robot around on the smooth marble floors of the 
                        science building, once it was put in grass it no longer was able to overcome the resistancce from the surface.
                        We were disappointed by this since we did not have time to fit it with more powerful motors however we were
                        happy that all the systems worked correctly. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We decided on a few steps that would be necessary to take in order for the project to advance. First, we 
                        should convert the chain-driven wheels to direct drive. Even though we did end up coming up with a patch for
                        the chain's slipping off, that took up a significant amount of time and it still wasn't perfect. We also hope 
                        to be able to attach a GPS module to the machine which would allow us to geofence a polygon within which the 
                        machine would map its own route. Ultimately, this would mean that the user has to program the boundaries of 
                        the yard once and then the Mowbot will do its job on its own with no further input needed from the human.
