                        necessary to start thinking about how I can develop my own web applications. Having a solid
                        foundation in logical thinking and writing code allowed me to worry less about chasing down bugs so I could 
                        spend more time exploring what the tools we were using could really do.

                        requirements to entering test records and performing test queries. For the first half of the semester, we spent 
                        a significant amount of time discussing the structure and operation of a relational database and learning SQL. 
                        Over the course of the second half of the semester, we were divided into groups of 4 and tasked with building 
                        a <a href = "projects.html#cs317">relational database</a> from scratch in <a href = "https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/sosedoff/pgweb"

                        Python (to which I am still preferential) and the Computer Architecture class I took the previous
                        semester included LC-3 assembly language and C. For this class, my four team mates and I built a 
                        GUI-based Freecell game from scratch. More in depth discussion of the game, along with screeenshots 
                        and a download of the code can be found <!--fix the code and link here-->here on the projects page.

                        still persist in today's language. This class also ignited in me the desire to carry out a text analysis research 
                        project on the corpus of Catullus. The project explores the themes of love and hate and how the poet uses these to 
                        relate to his audience.<!--link to catullus project here-->

                        speech made by Cicero in defense of a man, Sextus Roscius, accused of killing his father for the inheritance. 
                        We explored the complex Ciceronian sentence structure which is rich with subordinate clauses, catalogues and 
                        adjectival clauses physically disconnected from the nouns they describe. One of the focuses of the class was 
                        memorization and recitation of a section of the defense which drove home the skill of Roman orators not only 
                        in memorization but also in delivery.

                        This class allowed me the opportunity to build an arduino-based lawnmowing robot. We began with
                        an arduino, some motors, wheels, a weed wacker, an aluminum pipe and a plan. Our plan had to 
                        be revised a number of times but in only four weeks we were able to overcome a number of engineering 
                        challenges, both electronic and mechanical, and present a working remomte controlled prototype. You 
                        can read more about the process and planned improvements <a href = "projects.html#cs250">here.</a>
