                        necessary to start thinking about how I can develop my own web applications. Having a solid
                        foundation in logical thinking and writing code allowed me to worry less about chasing down bugs so I could 
                        spend more time exploring what the tools we were using could really do.

                        requirements to entering test records and performing test queries. For the first half of the semester, we spent 
                        a significant amount of time discussing the structure and operation of a relational database and learning SQL. 
                        Over the course of the second half of the semester, we were divided into groups of 4 and tasked with building 
                        a relational database from scratch in <a href = "https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/sosedoff/pgweb">pgweb</a>.

                        Python (to which I am still preferential) and the Computer Architecture class I took the previous
                        semester included LC-3 assembly language and C. For this class, my four team mates and I built a 
                        GUI-based Freecell game from scratch. More in depth discussion of the game, along with screeenshots 
                        and a download of the code can be found <!--fix the code and link here-->here on the projects page.

                        still persist in today's language. This class also ignited in me the desire to carry out a text analysis research 
                        project on the corpus of Catullus. The project explores the themes of love and hate and how the poet uses these to 
                        relate to his audience.
